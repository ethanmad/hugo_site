blurb: 'Election Audits was developed as part of EECS 498 (009) "Election Cybersecurity" with Dr. J. Alex Halderman. The course had students pick from a set of projects intended to practically improve election (cyber)security to work on in groups. My group (Jad Chaar, Reza Yovan, Siddarth Sawney, Jonson Jin, and myself), chose to create a web app to guide election officials through conducting risk-limiting post-election audits.'

Election Audits is a modern web app for auditing elections to help election officials use risk-limiting audits using [ballot-polling](https://github.com/ethanmad/RLA/blob/master/backend/audits/Bravo.py), [ballot-comparison](https://github.com/ethanmad/RLA/blob/master/backend/audits/SuperSimple.py), [canvass](https://github.com/ethanmad/RLA/blob/master/backend/audits/Cast.py), and [Bayesian ballot-polling](https://github.com/ethanmad/RLA/blob/master/backend/audits/BayesianPolling.py) audits; each supporting multiple winners/"vote for n". Also includes a sample-size demo page, comparing the risk limit of ballot-polling and ballot-comparison audits are arbitrary risk limits using real election data from [openelections.net](http://openelections.net).

My group was tasked with creating a user-friendly and "less-Javascripty" version of Dr. Philip Stark's [Tools for Ballot-Polling Risk-Limiting Election Audits](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Vote/ballotPollTools.htm) and [Tools for Comparison Risk-Limiting Election Audits](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Vote/auditTools.htm#) to guide real election officials through the auditing process. (We added three additional audit methods on top of the two Dr. Stark's website supports.) Especially with more and more states piloting risk-limiting audits, officials are in need of tools to help them conduct audits that don't require advanced statistical knowledge.  In our app, users need only fill out basic data regarding the ballot data and follow step-by-step instructions to conduct an audit.
Though most elections would have their audit methods determined by legislation, the home page describes differences between the methods we implemented and potential use-cases.

The app was implemented with a Python server and audit methods with a static frontend. The frontend communicates with the server using sockets, and the backend delegates requests to the appropriate audit method and returns responses to guide the user through the audit process.  The implementations of audit methods are Python translations of the pseudocode provided in the relevant literature. ^[["A gentle introduction to risk-limiting audits"][agi] (Lindeman and Stark 2012).]

As part of this project, I submitted changes to Ron Rivest's [2018-bptool][2018-bptool] project, in order to let [`BayesianPolling.py`](https://github.com/ethanmad/RLA/blob/master/backend/audits/BayesianPolling.py) be a wrapper around his code with the same interface as the other audit methods.

While the project was once live on [election-audits.org](https://election-audits.org), it was taken down after the conclusion of the class due to hosting costs.  However, it can still be used by election officials through local installations!

## Samples
Below are a few of the more interesting functions from [`Bravo.py`](https://github.com/ethanmad/RLA/blob/master/backend/audits/Bravo.py) (the ballot-comparison method we implemented), which do most of the audit method's work.

    ballots reported to show a vote for `winner` or `loser` or both.
