+++

I started fencing epee competitively in the Spring of 2012 at LAIFC, where I was very fortunate to train with some of the best fencers and coaches in the world.
Through many intense practices and about forty tournaments, I progressed very quickly.
The U.S. Fencing Association uses a rating system where beginners are unrated and more experienced fencers are rated from E to A, where A is the highest rating.
Within a year of training, I earned an E and a C.
A year later, I earned a B at a tournament at my club.

I ended up not fencing during my senior year of high school because of school and other obligations taking up my time.

Once I got to Michigan, I decided I had to start fencing again.
Fortunately for me, the University of Michigan Fencing Club is one of the top college clubs in the country, so I can practice regularly and compete at a high level.
Because of this, I've managed to maintain much of my skill and perhaps even improve.

Last weekend, I competed at the [Todd Curn Memorial tournament](https://askfred.net/Results/results.php?tournament_id=30100) hosted by Royal Arts Fencing Academy in Columbus, OH; won the gold medal; and finally earned my 'A' after coming so close so many times! Below is a playlist of YouTube videos with my final three elimination bouts (starting with the best bout--the semifinal).

My last two bouts were against 'A's and were generally regarded as some of the best fencers in the area.
In particular, my semifinal bout was one of the hardest fights I've ever had.
I was at one point down 9-13 (these bouts go to 15) and had to outscore my opponent 6-1 to win.

The win was easily one of the most gratifying experiences in my life--I've been on the other side enough times that finally being on the winning side felt beyond amazing.

Now that I've now achieved my long-standing goal of earning an 'A', I can focus on crushing our little brothers at MSU in school tournaments.
