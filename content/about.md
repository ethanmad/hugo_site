I'm Ethan Madison. I'm currently a dental student at the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry in San Francisco. I enjoy programming and building software, and I received a bachelor's degree in  computer science at the University of Michigan. During my time at Michigan, I was a member of the [fencing team](http://umich.edu/~fencing) on which I served as president and captain and won three national championships.

I am passionate about Free software, security, algorithms, and healthcare.
