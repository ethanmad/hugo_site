I'm Ethan Madison, a current high school senior at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles.
Next year, I'll be a computer science student at the University of Michigan--Ann Arbor.

This website serves as a blog and project showcase. I'll try to make a writeup for each project I complete and maybe make some other posts.
We'll see.

Note: this about page is not nearly done.
