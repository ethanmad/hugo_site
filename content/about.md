I'm Ethan Madison, a current high school senior at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles.
I write code, play drums, and fence in my free time.

## What is this site?
I have a dog named Hugo, which is part of the reason I chose Hugo as my static site generator.

This website serves as a blog and project showcase. I'll try to make a writeup for each project I complete and maybe make some other posts.
We'll see.
