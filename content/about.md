I'm Ethan Madison.
From Los Angeles, I attended the University of Michiganâ€”Ann Arbor, where I received my degree in computer science.  During my time at Michigan, I was a member of the [fencing team](http://umich.edu/~fencing) on which I served as president and captain and won three national championships.  Besides fencing, I also [write code](https://github.com/ethanmad) for fun.  I am passionate about Free software, security, algorithms, and healthcare.

I am back in Los Angeles and am looking for employment!
