I'm Ethan Madison; I'm from Los Angeles and am a freshan at the University of Michigan.
I write code, play drums, and fence in my free time.

## What is this site?
This website serves as a blog and project showcase. I plan on writing up post-mortems and summaries after completing a project in addition to normal blog posts.

The site is powered by [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io), which is coincidentally the name of [my dog](https://goo.gl/photos/gBoKEjAPGKBhmByP9 "Hugo the browser history inspector!").
