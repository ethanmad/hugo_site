## Current
  - [This site](https://www.ethanmad.com): I'm still working on adding content to this site and developing [its theme](https://github.com/keichi/vienna).
  - [pia-tools](https://github.com/ethanmad/pia-tools): A tool for more easily using Private Internet Access VPN services on SystemD+Linux systems (especially Arch Linux). I've taken over maintainership of the project (first package I've put on the AUR!).
  - [iHW-Android](https://github.com/hwcomputerscience/ihw-android): A schedule app for Harvard-Westlake. I'm the 2014-15 developer and am almost finished with my AppCompat redesign.

## Past

  - [LivingPlanet](http://livingplanet.paral.in/) (December 2014): My submission to and a finalist in the 2014 Koding Global Hackathon. A [Meteor](https://meteor.com) site built demonstrating issues on our planet. Built with [@paralin][paralin], [@jameslennon321][james], [@TheSafo][safo], & [@dwoldenberg1][wold] (GitHub usernames).
