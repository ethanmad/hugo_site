## Current
  - [This site](http://www.ethanmad.com): I'm still working on adding content to this site and refining its theme.
  - [Los Angeles](https://github.com/ethanmad/hugo-theme-losangeles): The theme for this site, forked from [Vienna](https://github.com/keichi/vienna). I'm planning on some header/footer customizations.
  - [auto-gapps.zip](https://github.com/ethanmad/auto-gapps.zip): An automatic gapps (Google apps for Android) builder using APKmirror.com. Currently non-functional due to pending changes on APKMirror.com.
  - [iHW-Android](https://github.com/hwcomputerscience/ihw-android): A schedule app for Harvard-Westlake. I'm the 2014-15 developer and am almost finished with my AppCompat redesign.
