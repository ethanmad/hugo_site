## Current
  - [This site](https://www.ethanmad.com): I'm still working on adding content to this site and developing [its theme](https://github.com/ethanmad/vienna).
  - [University of Michigan Fencing Club Website](http://umich.edu/~fencing) (Spring 2016 - present): I became webmaster in 2016 and realized that the site was difficult to update, edit, and keep consistent. I rebuilt the site Summer 2016 using Hugo to allow for easy updates, consistent theming, templating, and easy contributions from teammates. [Source](https://github.com/UM-Fencing/UMFC-Website).
  - [Hugo club-theme](https://github.com/UM-Fencing/club-theme) (Summer 2016 - present): The Hugo theme and layout template for the UMFC website and suitable for any student organization or club's website. A heavily modified fork of [key-amb/bootie-docs](https://github.com/key-amb/hugo-theme-bootie-docs).
