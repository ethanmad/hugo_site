## Current
  - **Fencing conference management software** (Spring/Summer 2019): An upcoming web app resulting from my frustration with handling of fencing conference seeding and results. The app will handle everything from results entry to ranking algorithms to championship seeding for teams and individual fencers. I hope to bring modern rankings methods, like Elo, to fencing in this endeavor. Updates to come.
  - [**elo**](https://github.com/ethanmad/elo): An Elo rating library written in pure Go. Written in Go, this library was built to be used as a rating provider for the above software.  Written with Zach Zipper.

## Past
  - **Operating Systems projects** (Winter 2019): Implemented a disk scheduler, threading library, virtual memory manager/pager, and a multi-threaded networked file system as part of EECS 482 Operating Systems.
  - [**Collabrify Venn**](https://venndiagram.imlc.io/) (Winter 2019): A real-time collaborative Venn diagramming web app built to help elementary school students and classrooms collaborate on Venn diagrams. Built as part of Dr. Eliott Soloway's [Integalactic Mobile Learning Center](http://www.imlc.io/) suite of apps, for his EECS 441 class, with Matt Kong and Barrett Fitzgerald. Built with React, Javascript, and broccoli. Tested with 3rd graders at Brick Elementary School in Ypsilanti, MI.
  - [**University of Michigan Fencing Club Website**](http://umich.edu/~fencing) (Spring 2016 -- Winter 2019): I became webmaster in 2016 and realized that the site was difficult to update, edit, and keep consistent. I rebuilt the site Summer 2016 using Hugo to allow for easy updates, consistent theming, templating, and easy contributions from teammates. [Source](https://github.com/UM-Fencing/UMFC-Website).
  - [**Hugo club-theme**](https://github.com/UM-Fencing/club-theme) (Summer 2016 -- Winter 2019): The Hugo theme and layout template for the UMFC website and suitable for any student organization or club's website. A heavily modified fork of [key-amb/bootie-docs](https://github.com/key-amb/hugo-theme-bootie-docs).
  - [**Election Audits: Risk-Limiting Audits**](/post/election-audits/) (Fall 2018): A web app to help election officials conduct risk-limiting audits. Built as part of Dr. J. Alex Halderman's [EECS 498 Election Cybersecurity](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs498.009/) class, with Jad Chaar, Reza Yovan, Jonson Jin, and Sidharth Sahwney.  The app was presented before the class and election officials. I worked primarily on the [audit algorithms](https://github.com/ethanmad/RLA/tree/master/backend/audits), which I implemented in Python.
  - [**"_In oder Aus_: Modern Improvements Upon and Applications of the Bloom Filter"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07353) (Fall 2018): A survey paper on Bloom filters, describing and analyzing a number of iterative and revolutionary improvements, as well as consequential uses of the data structure ranging from bioinformatics to networking. Written with Zach Zipper, this was presented as part of Dr. Seth Pettie's EECS 477 Algorithms class.
  - [**chromeos-resize**](https://github.com/ethanmad/chromeos-resize) (Summer 2016): A shell script to easily resize partitions on Chrome OS devices, typically used for dual-booting. Built with Eric Hegnes.
