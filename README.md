# Hugo Site
  This is my personal website/blog built using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).
  Hugo is a super-fast static site generator written in Go and happens to be the name of my beloved dog.

  The code for the site will live here and the compiled/built site will live in [ethanmad.github.io](https://github.com/ethanmad/ethanmad.github.io) so it can be public-facing at http://ethanmad.com.
