# Hugo Site
  This is my personal website/blog built using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).
  Hugo is a super-fast static site generator written in Go and happens to be the name of my beloved dog.

  I'm using my theme, [Los Angeles](https://github.com/ethanmad/hugo-theme-losangeles), for the site.

  The code for the site lives here and the built site lives in [ethanmad.github.io](https://github.com/ethanmad/ethanmad.github.io) so the site can be public facing at http://www.ethanmad.com.
